# Link to website

This project is made for an assignment in the front developer course. The site follows a graphic profile which I've created earlier in the course. 
First I started making wireframes for mobile, tablet and mobile. Then I proceeded with Figma to design mockups for all wireframes, and later on translated these into code.
